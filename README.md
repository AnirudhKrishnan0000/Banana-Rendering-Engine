# Banana-Rendering-Engine
This is for a project in Roblox Studio that I'm working on. There is an installer.

To install Banana Rendering Engine in your Roblox game, download the installer, the name is "main.lua".
After you have downloaded the Banana Rendering Engine Installer, go to Roblox Studio and open the game you want to install it on.
Click on Model at the top.
Select Advanced, then click "Run Script".
A file explorer window will popup asking you for the script. Select the installer and click "Open".
It will take a little bit of time to install.
After you see a grey screen, you will know that Banana Rendering Engine is installed.
To remove the grey screen, go to StaterGui, look for "BananaRenderingEngineGui". In your properties window, uncheck Enabled. This will turn off Banana Rendering Engine. To turn it on, check Enabled again.

NOTE: Terrain will not be rendered by Banana Rendering Engine. We recommend that if your game has terrain, avoid using Banana Rendering Engine or try to convert your terrain to parts.
